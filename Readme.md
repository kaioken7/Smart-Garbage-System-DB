Mini-Project for the OOP Course using Cpp

Abstract: To keep the Bhubaneswar city clean and green, the BMC is planning to implement smart

garbage processing. The new system would keep track of each citizen by recognizing their face. Smart

dustbins are to be kept in every possible point where garbage collection could be done. These smart

dustbins are enabled with high definition cameras and Wi-Fi to access internet. A dustbin recognizes a

citizen by face detection and records his/her activity in a central computer. Citizens are advised to use

different colored polythene bags to throw different types of garbage on a specific day in a week. For

example, on every Monday a citizen is allowed to use only pink color polythene to throw vegetable

garbage and nothing else. Similarly on Wednesday citizens are allowed to throw nonveg garbage only by

using blue color polythene. Upon violation of the above rules a fine of Rs. 500/- shall be imposed and

would automatically be deducted from a citizen’s bank balance. The implement this fine collection

system a citizen’s Adhar card and bank account details are required in the database.
